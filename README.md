# swiftui-target-architecture by MobileFactory (SBB)
This demo app showcases our implementation of the MVVM pattern for SwiftUI/Combine apps. It enables:
* Separation of concerns, so multiple developers know and understand what they are working on.
* Having SwiftUI Previews with mock data to efficiently develop and review UI, sometimes directly with designers and product owners.
* Having an architecture which is suitable for Unit Testing and UI Testing so we can have a high Code Coverage of our app and thus ensure correctness of our software.
